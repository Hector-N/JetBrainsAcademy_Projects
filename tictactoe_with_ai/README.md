## About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, 
also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, 
but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing! 

## Learning outcomes

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning 
and developing a complex program from scratch, 
using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. 
You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.
